# Intel-XDK-ionic-starter
A simple and complete Intel XDK Ionic Framework starter project to enable the use of Intel XDK HTML designer for your Ionic Framework project that can take full advantage AngularJS. The bundled Ionic Framework Starter in Intel XDK does not enable use of the powerful Intel XDK HTML Designer because of the way Angular JS requires HTML templates to be defined to enable one-page design.

# Installation

Open intel-xdk-ionic-angularjs-starter-template-masterfolder

# Note
That will be it. You will be prompted that it was created by an older version of intelXDK, so click "Upgrade" to continue. That may take a few seconds to a minute. New version built with latest IntelXDK will be available shortly.
